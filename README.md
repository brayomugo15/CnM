# CnM App - Android Mobile Application (for clients)

This is part of a two part construction app, bridging the gap between customers seeking construction contractors and contractors. Acts as a market place for contractors. Provides a quick and convenient way to connect the two parties.

This specific app allows clients or prospective clients to view available construction contractors, view their quotations and consultation fees before seeking consultation. To consult a contractor a fee (varies between contracting companies) will be paid through MPESA.
